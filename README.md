#     QUICK P-VALUE CALCULATOR
This code includes a function that takes the calculated statistical score (z score or t score), degrees of freedom (for t-score), and the type of test (one-tailed or two-tailed). It utilizes the appropriate statistical distribution functions from the scipy.stats module to calculate the p-value. It prints "Reject null hypothesis" or "Fail to reject null hypothesis".
